## Important Disclaimer - Adult and Potentially Disturbing Usage
This project, while public, is first and foremost for my home, family, friends, and partners. Expect features that include potentially disturbing or NSFW topics, including but not limited to:
- Sex
- NSFW Graphical Content
- Hypnosis
- Pavlovian Conditioning for Self-Improvement
- Personal Grimoires
- Relationship Anarchism
- Esoteric Exploration

Nothing is stopping you from stripping these elements out or hiding them. If this ever sees a notable amount of commercial use, then I will support this project and make a branch holding a non-NSFW version to pull from.

## ✨ Core Features (Modular Tabs)
- **Conditioning + Lovense Sync**: Hypnotic loops, affirmations, vibration patterns, and ritual triggers.
- **Shared Journaling**: Markdown-based daily logs, shared entries, import/export support.
- **Parenting Tracker**: Log behaviors, punishments, praise, and support for child-facing roles.
- **Mood + Health Monitor**: Track fibro flare-ups, mood swings, barometric pressure, and sleep.
- **Grocery + Chore Lists**: Divvy up labor fairly and clearly.
- **Gallery View**: Mosaic-style image albums with role-based visibility (e.g., Deviant-only NSFW).
- **Dock UI**: Toggle between sacred/scene apps, quick access via role-reactive dock.
- **Appointments + Daily Tab**: Comics, quotes, hypno cues, schedules.
- **Help Request System**: Tap to signal when you’re in crisis, need aftercare, or request support.

Access to different segments will be protected using claims-based access management and strong account security (including MFA). Custom claims to fine-tune access to various features or files will allow for strong access controls.
