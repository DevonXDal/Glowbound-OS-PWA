# 🦋 Glowbound OS Progressive Web App — A Shared Life Platform  
_Built for sacred intimacy, wellness, kink, and care._

This is an evolving modular PWA designed for small households, chosen families, and bonded partners to manage shared life with elegance, softness, and ritual.

Created by **Devon X. Dalrymple**, this project is a sacred and sensual PWA for love, logistics, and liberation.

## Important Disclaimer - Adult and Conditioning Usage
This project, while public, is first and foremost, for my home, family, friends, and partners. Expect features that include potentially disturbing or NSFW topics including but not limited to:
- Sex
- NSFW Graphical Content
- Hypnosis
- Pavlovian Conditioning
- Personal Grimoires
- Fibromyalgia
- Relationship Anarchism
- Esoteric Exploration

Nothing is stopping you from stripping these elements out or hiding them. If this ever sees a notable amount of commercial use, then I will support this project and make a branch holding a non-NSFW version to pull from.

## ✨ Core Features (Modular Tabs)
- **Conditioning + Lovense Sync**: Hypnotic loops, affirmations, vibration patterns, and ritual triggers.
- **Shared Journaling**: Markdown-based daily logs, shared entries, import/export support.
- **Parenting Tracker**: Log behaviors, punishments, praise, and support for child-facing roles.
- **Mood + Health Monitor**: Track fibro flareups, mood swings, barometric pressure, and sleep.
- **Grocery + Chore Lists**: Divvy up labor fairly and clearly.
- **Gallery View**: Mosaic-style image albums with role-based visibility (e.g., Deviant-only NSFW).
- **Dock UI**: Toggle between sacred/scene apps, quick access via role-reactive dock.
- **Appointments + Daily Tab**: Comics, quotes, hypno cues, schedules.
- **Help Request System**: Tap to signal when you’re in crisis, need aftercare, or request support.
